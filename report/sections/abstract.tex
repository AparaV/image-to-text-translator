{Software recognition of data and images is a common area of interest. One of the methods for data recognition is through Support Vector Machines (SVM). These networks operating by taking initial vectors, support vectors, which are already classified and are used in order to train the program to be able to accurately predict which data set a new vector comes from. These can be implemented to recognize the digits 0 through 9 by transforming each of the images of digits into vectors. Once the SVM is trained with images of digits (from MNIST) this can then be used to read these digits with some accuracy.}
