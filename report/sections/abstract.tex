{Classifying text in images is an interesting problem. In this report, we study Support Vector Machines (SVM)\cite{statistical-learning} and how we can use them to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST database\cite{mnist}. SVM is able to classify data into two different classes by constructing a hyperplane that separates the two classes. For our application, we have $10$ different classes ($10$ digits). So, we constructed $10$ optimal hyperplanes, one for each digit $k$ which was able to classify the image as either digit $k$ or not.}

\noindent
{In case the data is not linearly separable, it is impossible to construct such an optimal hyperplane. For such, data we need to use a kernel to transform the data such that it becomes linearly separable. We used $4$ different kernels - linear, quadratic, cubic, and sigmoid kernel. The quadratic transformation of the data provided the best results with an accuracy of $98.08$ \% and the sigmoid transformation gave the worst results with an accuracy of $10.09$ \%.}
